### Welcome to your informational overload fix :)

<br>

This is:

- A place to gather and reference interesting resources for ourselves and one another.

- A fantastic place to start engaging with GitHub and get your piscine flavored hyper-intimacy fix.

- A place to collaborate in curating those resources.

- A perfect place for anyone looking to make their first contribution to a public repository.

- A place to share your favorite tutorials, repos, code snippets, project ideas, datasets, etc. on a new topic!

- A place that needs a new name.

- A place to track my (/our?) progress in learning the robot framework.

### Contributions
Although this repository was adopted for use by a specific set of curious people, all contributions are welcome. We adopt the learn-by-diving-in-head-first approach which has already trauma welded some of us together, so if you want to make a contribution or a correction of any kind feel free to open a pull request!

Check the [contribution guidelines](contributions.md) for more information.

I haven't seriously engaged with GitHub in ages so we may be learning together. Check out the [resources page for Git and GitHub](resources/git_and_github.md) for some good starting points.
